What is the status of your project?
Part 1 is finished, working on part 2.


What has each team done to ensure the success of the team?
We worked together a lot of the time and aided each other. Here is a general breakdown of each team member's major contributions:
Ashley: Created FileToSentences class, turned the input file contents into a list of sentences, removed excess punctuation
  and new "enters/new lines" from contents, and added the -s functionality.
Matt: Created SentenceCleaner class, implemented the stopwords.txt filtering, created ConvertToListList method, 
  converted letters to lowercase, and used stemming for root words.


What can each team member do going forward to ensure the success of the team?
Keep up good communication and teamwork. Also, keep the git as up-to-date as possible.
